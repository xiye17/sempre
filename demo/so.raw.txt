#	NL	Sketch
2	write regular expression in C# to validate that the input does not contain double spaces	not(contain(?{< >}))
3	write regular expression that allows only digits, characters like "&" "|" "." "(" ")" and spaces	?{<num>,or(<&>,or(<|>,or(<.>,or(<(>,or(<)>,< >)))))}
6	The input will be in the form a colon (:) separated tuple of three values. The first value will be an integer (potentially a long in terms of size/length), with the other two values being either numeric or a string.	
8	It should accept numbers only with decimal part "0" or "5" only.	sep(?{repeatatleast(<num>,1),or(<0>,<5>)},<.>)
9	I want this value to accept up to 18 digits before the decimal, and 1 digit after. With the decimal point and the digit after it being optional	sep(?{repeatrange(<num>,1,18),<num>},<.>)
10	The value should not contain only "%" and if there is a "%" the length should be more than 3 characters including "%". "%" can be anywhere in the string (dot is included)	TBD
11	I want to develop one regular expression which validates only strings which have "A", "B" or "C"	?{or(<A>,or(<B>,<C>))}
12	optional number of digits followed by an "X" and an optional ("^" followed by one or more digits)	TBD
15	i need a Regular that validate Decimal (18,3) this mean max number of digits before comma is 15 and accept 3 numbers after comma . 18 precision 3 scale.	concat(?{<num>},?{<,>,repeatrange(<num>,1,3)})
18	accept numeric values that are seven or ten digits	?{or(repeat(<num>,7),repeat(<num>,10))}

21	I need a regular expression that validates a number, but doesn't require a digit after the decimal	sep(?{<num>},<.>)
24	I need to validate each sub string length is 3 which is split by comma.	sep(?{repeat(<any>,3)},<,>)
25	I need a regular expression that can validate that a string is an alphanumeric comma delimited string.	sep(?{<alphanum>},<,>)
29	Can anyone please help me to find the suitable regular expression to validate a string that has comma separated numbers	sep(?{<num>},<,>))
31	I want to validate if my input consists starting with 8 hexadecimal characters followed by a underscore, followed by any number of characters with any value.	concat(repeat(<hex>,8),concat(<_>,?{<let>}))
40	i need regular expression for : one or two digits then "." and one or two digits.	concat(or(repeat(<num>,1),repeat(<num>,2)),?{<.>,or(repeat(<num>,1),repeat(<num>,2))})
42	I need to validate the next pattern: starts with "C0" and finish with 4 digits exactly	?{concat(<C>,<0>),startwith(concat(<C>,<0>)),repeat(<num>,4)}

48	I need to validate a string that contains underscore(_) in between the numbers. Underscore character is an optional. Only condition is, it should be between the numbers.	sep(?{<num>},<_>)
51	I need to match only strings that include one character "/" between numbers or integer numbers.	sep(?{<num>},</>)
52	Allows only the following characters: Letters, numbers, spaces and any of the following characters "_" "-" "+" "(" ")" "/" "\"	?{or(<let>,<num>),< >,or(<_>,or(<->,or(<+>,or(<(>,or(<)>,or(</>,<\>))))))}
56		
58	it doesn't start with a space, doesn't contain a space, and doesn't end with a space.	?{not(startwith(< >)),not(contain(< >)),not(endwith(< >))}
64	What is the regex that matches 6 characters, first is a letter, others are numbers	concat(?{repeat(<any>,6),<let>,<num>},?{repeat(<any>,6),<let>,<num>})
67	the expression is a alphanumeric one(where the alphabets are optional) where the alphabets can be only "d" | "D" | "w" | "W" | "m" | "M" | "q" | "Q" | "y" | "Y" and can appear only after the numerals. Also if any character can come before any numerals that can only be a minus.	
68	The name must only consist of letters, numbers and one or more single spaces (not in the beginning or end). The minimum length is 3 characters.	 ?{<let>,<num>,repeatatleast(< >,1),< >,repeatatleast(<let>,3)}
73	I would like regex to be a whole number with thousands separated with a comma. No decimal. No "$".	?{<num>,<,>,not(contain(<$>)),not(contain(<.>))}
74	I'm looking for a regular expression that will match text given the following requirements: contains only 10 digits (only numbers); starts with "9".	?{repeat(<num>,10),startwith(<9>)}
75	Need a regular expression to validate number with comma separator.	sep(?{<num>},<,>)
76	valid characters are alphanumeric and "."(period). The patterns are "%d4%" and "%t7%". So "%" is not valid by itself, but has to be part of these specific patterns.	?{<alphanum>,<.>,or(concat(<%>,concat(<t>,concat(<7>,<%>))),concat(<%>,concat(<d>,concat(<4>,<%>)))))))}
77-The input box should accept alphanumeric with no space and it should also allow the user to use the characters like "~" "!" "@" "#" "$" "-" "_" any where in the string, except these characters non of the other characters should be allowed like ("%",  "&", "^" etc). It should not allow leading/trailing whitespace also.	?{<alphanum>,or(<~>,or(<!>,or(<@>,or(<#>,or(<$>,or(<->,<_>))))))}
78	Should allow only alphanumeric with no space and no other characters including "_". It should not allow leading/trailing whitespace also.	?{<alphanum>,< >,<_>,not(startwith(< >)),not(endwith(< >))}
79	I'm trying to use regular expressions to match a string that does not contain the sequence of characters of a less than symbol "<" followed by a non space.	?{concat(<<>,notcc(< >))}
80	the number with 10 or more digits and that number should not have "$" symbol in front of it.	?{repeatatleast(<num>,10),<$>}
81	It should allow only one space between words. That is, total number of spaces between words or characters should only be one.It should ignore leading and trailing spaces.	sep(?{<let>},< >)
83	I'm trying to validate a form using regular expressions, the conditions are: It has to be a numeric value. It CAN have up to three decimal places(0,1,2 are allowed too).It has to be divided by a comma(,).	sep(?{<num>,repeatrange(<num>,1,3)},<,>)
84	I am trying to make a regular expression that validates letters, numbers and spaces ONLY.	?{<let>,<num>,< >}
85	The input box should accept only if either (1) first 2 letters alpha + 6 numeric or (2) 8 numeric	?{repeat(<let>,2),repeat(<num>,6),repeat(<num>,8)}
86	a regular expression for validating a string with alphanumeric characters and dashes, while also not allowing leading or trailing dashes	?{<alphanum>,<->}
87		
88	The value can have at max 3 decimals (but also none) with comma as the separator.	sep(?{repeatrange(<num>,1,3)},<,>)
90	I want regex that only validates that the field contains digits, but that does not care about how many.	?{<num>}
95		
96	I want a regular expression that validates a string of length 1 which has either the characters "A" or "B" (case insensitive) at the Begin	?{or(<A>,<B>)}
100	The string must be 9 characters long, starting with "SO-" (case insensitive eg "So-", "so-", "sO-" and "SO-") followed by 6 numbers.	concat(or(concat(<S>,concat(<o>,<->)),or(concat(<s>,concat(<o>,<->)),or(concat(<s>,concat(<O>,<->)),concat(<S>,concat(<O>,<->))))),?{repeat(<num>,6)})
101	The first character should be a designated character like "A", "B" or "C" only. and the next 3 characters should be numbers.	?{or(<A>,or(<B>,<C>)),repeat(<num>,3),<num>}
102	I have one field that is meant to allow a 1 - 3 character string. The first character has got to be "A", "B", "C" or "Z" and may optionally be followed by upto 2 characters.	?{or(<A>,or(<B>,or(<C>,<Z>))),optional(?{repeatrange(<let>,1,2)})}
