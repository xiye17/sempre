The input will be in the form a <M0> separated tuple of three values 
The first value will be an integer (potentially a long in terms of size/length) 
with the other two values being either numeric or a string
4
Need to validate the following string using regular expression: Key = Value ; Key = Value ; Key = Value and so on.
Key and value can contain anything except <M0> and <M1>
Key and Value both cannot be blank or empty with <M2>
Input string does not ends with <M3>
1
It should accept numbers only with decimal part 0 or 5 only.
2
The value should not contain only <M0> and if there is a <M1> the length should be more than 3 characters including <M2>. 
<M3> can be anywhere in the string (dot is included).
