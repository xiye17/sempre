The input will be in the form a <M0> separated tuple of three values. The first value will be an integer (potentially a long in terms of size/length), with the other two values being either numeric or a string
Need to validate the following string using regular expression: Key = Value ; Key = Value ; Key = Value and so on. 1. Key and value can contain anything except <M0> and <M1> 2. Key and Value both cannot be blank or empty with sapces 3. Input string does not ends with <M3>
It should accept numbers only with decimal part 0 or 5 only.
The value should not contain only <M0> and if there is a <M1> the length should be more than 3 characters including <M2>. <M3> can be anywhere in the string (dot is included).
I need to create a regular expression for a string in the format <whole-number> <M0> <whole-numbers> <M1> 1. only single numeric digit should be allowed before <M2> 2. only <M3> special character after the numeric digit 3. there should be only 3 or less numeric digits after the <M4> 4. only <M5> special character should be allowed at the end of the string.
I'm trying to write a regular expression to check whether or not a proposed name is valid in a gaming platform. Rules: 1. Name must contain at least 3 and no more than 20 letters 2. Name must start with a uppercase letter 3. Name must never have two uppercase letters in a row 4. <M0> are allowed, but must be preceded by a letter and be followed by an uppercase letter 5. <M1> are allowed, but must be preceded by a letter and be followed by a lowercase letter 6. All uppercase letters must be followed by a lowercase letter unless they are followed by a <M2> or <M3>
I need their cell phone formats to be like this  04AB-XXXXXXX Where A can be either 1 or 2 and B can be either 2, 4 or 6 X can be from 0-9 There must be exactly 7 numbers (X) after 04AB It must always start with <M0>
How should I write my regular expressions code to match following criteria? It consists of at least two <M0> - separated names All <M1> - separated names at least 2 characters long At least one <M2> - separated name is at least 4 characters long
I'm looking for the perfect regular expression for validation a german car license the number has too look like this: 1. 1 - 3 Letters 2. a <M0> (i know the minus is now out of date, but the customer want it that way) 3. 1 - 2 Letters 4. a <M1> 5. 1 - 4 numbers
I need a regular expression in .net which 1. will only allow a maximum of two digits after <M0> 2. will only allow a maximum of two digits before <M1> 3. has a maximum length of 5 4. represents a number greater than 0 5. represents a number not greater than 100 6. has a number not greater than 11 after <M2>
