Test on utterance 1 : I need a regular expression that satisfy these rules: 1. The maximum number of decimal point is 3 but a number with no decimal point (e.g 12) should be accepted too 2. the value must be at least 0 3. the value must be less or equal to 99999999999.999 4. the radix point is DOT (e.g 2.5, not 2,5)
